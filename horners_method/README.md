# Horner's method

It's a method of calculating the value of a polynomial for a given input. **It is possible to prove
that Horner's method has a minimal complexity**, meaning that it requires a minimal number of
multiplications and additions to compute.

> Horner's method is optimal, in the sense that any algorithm to evaluate an arbitrary polynomial
> must use at least as many operations.
